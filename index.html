            <!-- <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p> -->
    
            <p>Animals are intelligent, sentient individuals. We refer to them as “he/she” or “them/they,” or by species. The words “it” or “thing” are never used to refer to an animal, and “who” is used rather than “that.” If you do not know the gender, choose one: “he” or “she.” Even if your gender choice is wrong, it is more respectful than “it.” This is an important way of demonstrating the respect we ask others to afford all animals</p>
            <hr> 
            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why are animals abused?</h2>
            <p>There are many different reasons why individuals abuse animals. Animal cruelty covers a wide range of actions (or lack of action), so one blanket answer simply isn’t possible. Each type of abuse has displayed certain patterns of behavior that we can use to help understand more about why people commit the crimes we encounter today.</p>

            <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p> -->
            <!-- <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>“The love for all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man.”
              </p>
            </blockquote> -->
            <!-- <p>This quote was made by Charles Darwin the man who discovered evolution, which plays a great role in identifying the existence of us animals.</p> -->
            <p>People abuse animals for a variety of reasons and  with varying levels of harm. Some acts of  animal cruelty are the result of ignorance about humane and  proper care of animals or impulsive actions stemming from unmanaged emotions. <br> <br> Animal cruelty may also be very deliberate, planned and goal directed such as in domestic violence situations where the abuser may be harming an animal to intimidate, terrorize and/or coerce a victim and/or for retaliatory acts towards a victim. <br><br> Sadistic individuals derive pleasure from causing and observing other living creatures experience pain. In other instances the abuse may be less intentional and influenced more by the diminished mental state of the individuals such as hoarders, whose perception of their environment and behaviors is extremely distorted. When individuals diminish or deny or fail to recognize the sentient capacities of animals, the likelihood of abuse is increased</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Adopt A Pet</dt>
              <dd>Over 100,000 animals are rescued by the RSPCA annually. About 30% of the rescued animals are put down because it is impossible to home them. Numbers don’t lie. There are so many animals that are available for adoption.
                  <dd>Therefore, if you want to contribute toward ending animal cruelty, adopting a pet is a great way to start. Adopting pets will further stop some of the breeders from attacking strangers. Several dog breeding facilities are operated under poor conditions that do not meet the required behavioral, physiological, and social dog needs</dd>
                  </dd>
              <dt>Proper Care For Your Pet</dt>
              <dd>As a pet owner, you must take care of your cat or dog. Research shows that a lot of pets suffer from lack of exercise, inadequate care, and neglect. Know what your pet needs and provide it before it is too late.
                <dd>Your pet needs regular checkups to stay healthy. Ensure that you take your pet to a veterinary clinic for vaccines. The vet also gets to examine your pet to ensure that it is growing well without signs of illness.</dd></dd>
              <dt>Donate To Rescue Groups</dt>
              <dd>Find out what your local SPCA(Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) needs and donate. You could donate toys, food, or blankets. You may not be in a position to own a pet, but by simply donating, the pets feel the love.
                  <dd>Other than donating, you can volunteer at your local SPCA to walk the pets, wash, groom the animals, or clean the shelters</dd></dd>
              <dt>Teach Compassion For Animals To Kids</dt>
              <dd>Psychologists report that many kids who are cruel to animals grow up to be cruel to fellow humans. As an adult, it is your responsibility to teach children to treat animals with respect and kindness. A great way to do this is to be a role model. If you are kind to pets, your kids are most likely to follow suit.
                  <dd>As part of community service and a great way to instill the virtue of kindness in your kids, you can volunteer at your local <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/6.9310948,124.8942806/spca/@7.0871151,124.9179707,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x32f96ce0c2d14127:0x96f1825b03fcd507!2m2!1d125.4351022!2d7.1859054">SPCA</a> . If you own a pet, taking your child for veterinary hospital visits is a great way to show the importance of caring for animals</dd></dd>
              <dt>Purchase Humane Animal Products</dt>
              <dd>If you eat meat, it is important to try and buy organic and meat free-range. It is not always possible but you can try. The meat industry can be very cruel especially when it comes to high turnover for inexpensive meat.
                  <dd>Any time you eat out, it would help to ask where it’s from and if a place does not get its meat humanely, stop going there. The RSPCA has a list of brands that are offering cruelty-free eggs. If you eat dairy, it would help save animals if you checked it out.</dd></dd>
              <dt>Stop Littering and Reduce Your Plastic Consumption</dt>
              <dd>Plastic is harmful to the environment, especially wildlife. Reducing your plastic consumption will go a long way in protecting animals.
                      <dd>Any time you litter, you increase the chances of an animal accidentally eating the litter. Avoid littering. If you see someone litter, gently remind them that what they are doing is harmful to animals</dd></dd>
